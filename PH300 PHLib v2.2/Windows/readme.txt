This is the PicoQuant PicoHarp 300 programming library 'PHLib.dll' pack.
It may be distributed on CD or as a zip file via email or download.
In case of a zip file, please unpack it to a temporary hard disk location. 

Note: Using the programming library requires a firmware update of your 
PicoHarp 300, unless you already bought it with the DLL option 
installed. You can purchase an upgrade and install it any time later.

The programming library is suitable for Windows ME, 2000, XP and Vista.  
On some Windows versions you may need administrator rights to do the setup.
Consult your manual for detailed installation instructions. 

The folder "installation" contains the PHLib setup file Setup.exe.
You can run Setup.exe directly from this folder on the CD or hard disk.

The setup program will install the programming library including manual, 
and programming demos. It will not install the device driver for the PicoHarp. 
This is done by the regular Windows PnP device management. When prompted 
for a driver location, please point to the folder "driver" under the PHLib 
software installation folder. Similarly, you can use this location for a 
manual driver update via the Windows device manager.

In your chosen installation folder Setup will create a subfolder DEMO 
which contains demo source code for accessing and using the DLL
from various programming languages.

To uninstall the PicoHarp programming library choose system>software and 
select  'PicoQuant - PH300-PHLib vx.x' for de-installation. 
This will remove all files that were installed by the setup program except
any user files.
