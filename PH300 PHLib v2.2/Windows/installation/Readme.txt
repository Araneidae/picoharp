Installation 

Before installation, make sure to backup any work you kept in previous
installation directories and uninstall any older versions of PHLib.
The PHLib package can be distributed on CD, via download or via email.
The setup distribution file is setup.exe.
If you received the package via download or email, it may be packed in a 
zip-file. Unzip that file and place the distribution setup file in a 
temporary disk folder. Start the installation by running setup.exe before
connecting the PicoHarp device.
On some versions of Windows you may need to log on as administrator.

The setup program will install the programming library including manual, 
and programming demos. It will not install the device driver for the PicoHarp. 
This is done by the regular Windows PnP device management. When prompted 
for a driver location, please point to the folder "driver" under the PHLib 
software installation folder. Similarly, you can use this location for a 
manual driver update via the Windows device manager.


To uninstall the PHLib package, you may need to be logged on as administrator. 
Backup your measurement data before uninstalling.
From the start menu select:  PicoQuant - PH300-PHLib v2.x  >  uninstall.
Alternatively you can use the Control Panel Wizard 'Add/Remove Programs'
(in some Windows versions this Wizard is called 'Software')
