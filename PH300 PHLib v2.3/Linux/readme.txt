for Linux. It may be distributed on CD or as a zip file via email or download.
In case of a zip file, please unpack it to a temporary hard disk location.

installed. You can purchase an upgrade and install it any time later.

The programming library is suitable for Linux 2.6.x on 32 bit x86 systems.  
The folder "library" contains the PHLib files you need to install.
The folder "demos" can be copied to your home directory or anywhere you 
like to work and try the demos.
